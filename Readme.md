## Tasks
1. Implement feed forward network, backprop and loss function with Numpy.
2. Construct a regression neural network with previously implemented layers to predict the heating load.
3. Construct a classification neural network with previously implemented layers to predict the ionosphere type.
4. Plot the learning curve and error with Matlibplot to estimate the performance.
